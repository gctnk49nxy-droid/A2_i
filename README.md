## 1-Requirements
Problem Statement: Given a sample of digital books create partitions of 100 words of the book text, then with those partitions select a random sample of 200 paritions of each book. We need to generalize the program to do this with multiple books and maintain the label as to what book they belong to. 

For this assignment, the purpose is to, given a selection of text from books, chunk the text so 100 words make up a single partition, from within each book randomly select 200 partitions to make up your sample. We need to ensure that each parition can still be traced back to its associated source book. We also want to make sure this program can handle a large number of books.
